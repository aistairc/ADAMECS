* Main program is `test_main.m'
* To run the program, 
  1) fix `code_folder' and `data_folder' to match your environment
  2) put LDA data in CSV format in Data folder
* Run test_main.m from MATLAB's command window
* The program produces 5 predictions (5 `ans=' in the command window)

Introduction
=================================================

This is the documentation of the ADAMECS evaluation suite.

=================================================
How to run
=================================================

ADAMECS requires recorded EMG data in CVS format.
Place EMG data in the `Debug' folder and run test_main.m 
from Matlab's command window.

test_main.m will make estimations that
indicates hand & arm motion of the EMG data.

We apologize for no sample EMG data 
due to Japan's privacy law.
